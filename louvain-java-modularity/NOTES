NEIGHBOR maps half-edge to destination node:
destination: half-edge
0: 2, 5
1: 0, 6, 7
2: 1, 3
3: 4, 11, 14, 17
4: 8, 15, 18
5: 9, 12, 19
6: 10, 13, 16


indices of neighbors are half-edges
elements in neighbors are vertices
so neighhbor[i] means that for half-edge i, it is connected to some destination node neighbor[i]
