nNeighbors
	- int array
	- length nNodes
	- i'th place is the number of neighbors that node i has

edgeWeight1

edgeWeight2

node1 and node2 are int arrays that store the input from the graph input fule. For some edge e, node1[e] stores the start vertex, and node2[e] stores the destination vertex. It is enforced that start vertex < destination vertex.
