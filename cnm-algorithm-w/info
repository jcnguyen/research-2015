notes:
when you use recordGroupListsFormatted(), the commID will be different from the original (recordGroupListsFormatted zero-indexes the commID whereas the original is based on its position in the array)
	e.g.
	original -> formatted
		2			0
		10          1
		44			2
		137			3
		148			4
		167			5
the other files (.wpairs and .joins) will display information based on the original commID, so make sure to use recordGroupLists() if you wanna compare info between .groups and .wpairs/.joins
