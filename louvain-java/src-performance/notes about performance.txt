The results of Louvain-performance are especially unexpected, as the performance metric is unable to handle self-loops, which Louvain uses to store intra-community edge weights in between passes. Furthermore, performance scores for graphs with even one extreme high outlier are greatly skewed, because the metric uses a meaningful maximum of edge weights to estimate the weights of nonexistent edges. However, in some graphs, tweaking the meaningful maximum allowed us to identify communities similar to the ground truth communities.
