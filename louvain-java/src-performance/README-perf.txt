This documentation is specifically for running the Java code for the Louvain 
method using performance, which is found in “/research-2015/louvain-java/src-performance.”

The test suite can be found in the Box account under "Graphs". 

Running
----------
1. Download the code and test suite (see "Download").
2. Open the command line.
3. Change the directory to the src directory of the Louvain Method Java code. 
   $ cd ../research-2015/louvain-java/src-performance
   where ".." is the path to the research folder.
4. To compile,
   $ javac *.java
5. To run, 
   $ java ModularityOptimizer input output v resolution M n_random_starts n_iterations random_seed print

The command line arguments are as follows:
input            Input file name. Extension should be .pairs for unweighted 
                   graphs and .wpairs for weighted graphs.
output           Output file name. No extension - the algorithm will append the file endings.
v	       	  V is the scaling parameter that rates the importance of the
    		    weight of intercluster edges (with respect to the weight of 
		    the intra-cluster edges). Can be between 0 and 1, inclusive.
		    This value is unique to performance.
resolution       Value of the resolution parameter
M        	  Meaningful maximum of edge weights. This value is unique to 			    	    performance. Setting M is as less than the input graph’s
		    maximum edge weight will result in the algorithm setting all edge 			    weights greater than M equal to M.
n_random_starts  Number of random starts
n_iterations     Number of iterations per random start
random_seed      Seed of the random number generator
print            Whether or not to print output to the console 
                   0 = no
                   1 = yes

Test Run
----------
We run the test case using the Louvain method with modularity with the 
following arguments:
    input            ../test/test.pairs
    output           ../output-perf/test
    v	              1 = weight them equally
    resolution       1.0
    M       	      1 for unweighted graphs.
		        Varies for weighted graphs;
		        For suggested M’s for our test suite, 
			see the column M(perf) in https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11j7ESk_izWIaDsI2iMIFlhAaivLqxRDWDn5OOGQTkO0/edit?usp=sharing. 
			The “Max” column sets M to the max edge weight;
			the REHO column sets M to the max edge weight 
			excluding extreme high outliers. The percentage in parentheses
			is the % of data considered an extreme high outlier.
    n_random_starts  1
    n_iterations     1
    random_seed      0
    print            1 = yes

Input the following in the command line:
$ javac *.java
$ java ModularityOptimizer ../test/test.pairs ../output-perf/test 1 1.0 M 1 1 0 1

Expected output:
1. Output files in “/research-2015/louvain-java/output”:
	1. test.graph: final clustering output
	2. test.perfgraph: after Louvain runs to completion, we calculate the performance score for each of the intermediate clusterings. We find the clustering with the best performance score. The score and clustering are printed here.
	3. test.tree: the intermediate clusterings.
	4. test.info: to save a record of the command line output (see below), add &> test.info at the end.
