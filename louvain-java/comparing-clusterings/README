README for compare_clustering_stats.py

=== SUMMARY ===
Takes in an input network and two clusterings of that network.
Computes the Meila, NMI, split-join distance, Rand index, and adjusted Rand index.
Prints scores in tab-delimited format and CSV to the command line.

=== INDEXES ===
Meila index
- Meila (2003)
- Always non-negative; lower is better (0 --> identical communities)

Normalized mutual information
- Danon et al (2005)
- Between 0 and 1; higher is better (1 --> identical communities)

Split-join distance
- Dongen (2000)
- lower is better
- couldn't find PDF of van Dongen S: Performance criteria for graph clustering and Markov cluster experiments. Technical Report INS-R0012, National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands, Amsterdam, May 2000.

Rand index
- Rand (1971)
- Between 0 and 1; 1 is better (1 --> identical communities)

Adjusted Rand index
- Normalized difference between Rand Index and its expected value under the null hypothesis
- Expected between 0 and 1; 1 is better (1 --> identical communities)
- Can be negative in extreme mismatches

=== COMMAND LINE INPUT ===
python compare_clustering_stats.py input_network first_clustering second_clustering verbose

Details:
	input_network: file containing an edgelist (with or without weights) representing network (.wpairs, .pairs)
	first_clustering: file containig one clustering of the input_network (.graph, .perfgraph)
	second_clustering: another clustering of the input_network, to be compared to first_clustering (.graph, .perfgraph)
	verbose: if 1, will print the input network and two clusterings, and will label the statistic output

=== COMMAND LINE OUTPUT (not verbose) ===
EXAMPLE:
	Reading input network from file... finished reading input network.
	Reading and forming clusterings... done creating clusterings.

	Separated by tabs:
	1.84351062936	0.259874482177	22.0	0.522281639929	0.034671392249

	CSV format:
	1.84351062936,0.259874482177,22.0,0.522281639929,0.034671392249

=== COMMAND LINE OUTPUT (verbose) ===
EXAMPLE:
	Reading input network from file... 
	[input network here]
	finished reading input network.
	Reading and forming clusterings... done creating clusterings.
	[first clustering here]
	[second clustering here]

	Meila (2003): 1.84351062936
	Normalized mutual information, Danon et al (2005): 0.259874482177
	Split-join distance, van Dongen (2000): 22.0
	Rand index, Rand (1971): 0.522281639929
	Adjusted Rand index, Hubert and Arabie (1986) 0.034671392249

=== OUTPUT FORMATS ===
	Tab-delimited format can be pasted (w/o other formatting) in a spreadsheet and will automatically be put into separate cells. CSV can be read as a spreadsheet.
