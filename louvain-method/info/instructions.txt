/*****************************************
 * Downloading the Graphs
 *****************************************/
1. Go to http://cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/matrices/Newman/index.html
2. Click on a graph: "Newman/some_graph"
3. Click "download in Matrix Market format." The file will start downloading.
4. Click on "Downloads" folder on the launcher
5. Double click on some_graph.tar to unzip the file
6. Drag the some_graph folder into a folder used to hold graphs

/*****************************************
 * Converting the Graphs to Zero-Index
 *****************************************/
1. Compile the program by running the following commands 
   (you only have to do this once):
		make clean
		make
2. Run it (choose one, based on weighted and unweighted)
		unweighted: 
		./indexzero -i input_filename.txt > output_filename.txt

		weighted:   
		./indexzero -i input_filename.txt -w > output_filename.txt

	where "input_filename.txt" is the name of the input graph, and 
	"output_filename.txt" is the name of the output file 

/*****************************************
 * Running the Graph through the Algorithm
 *****************************************/
1. Compile the algorithm by running the following commands(
   you only have to do this once):
		make clean
		make

2. Convert the graph into something the machine can read
		unweighted:
		./convert -i graph.txt -o graph.bin

		weighted
		./convert -i graph.txt -o graph.bin -w

3. Convert the graph into a community graph 
   (note that this only specifies the modularity version. if you're using 
   	the coverage version, replace "modularity" with "coverage")
		unweighted:
		./community_modularity graph.bin -l -1 -v > graph-modularity.tree

		weighted:
		./community_modularity graph.bin -l -1 -v -w > graph-modularity.tree

4. Print the community graph into a file
		./hierarchy graph-modularity.tree
		./hierarchy -l the_highest_level > graph-abbreviationOfAlgorithm-metric.graph.graph

	where "the_highest_level" is the highest level specified after doing 
	"./hierarchy graph.tree"
    
    The naming convention for graph.graph is 
    "graph-abbreviationOfAlgorithm-metric.graph"
    	ex: graph-LM-modularity.graph
    	    graph-LM-coverage.graph
    	    graph-CNM-modularity.graph
    	    graph-CNM-coverage.graph

/*****************************************
 * Using the Command-Line
 *****************************************/
- Basic Commands:
	1. ls - lists the files for this current folder
	2. cd folder_name - changes directory to folder_name
	   cd .. - moves current directory up one level
- Compiling: there are two ways
	2. make clean - cleans out the already compiled stuff 
	   (you want to do this so that there isn't architecture problems)
	   make - compiles everything
    - note: you have to be in the folder that contains these files 
      if you want to use them
